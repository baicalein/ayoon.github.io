## Project
**Machine Learning Predictive Models on Early Discontinuation of Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy, Adalimumab (_2023 - Present_)**
- **Retrospective Observational Study (_2023 - 2025_)**: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating Adalimumab may discontinue treatment within six months due to loss of efficacy or lack of perceived benefit. Specialty pharmacies are well-positioned to intervene early, but identifying patients at high risk for early discontinuation remains a clinical challenge. We analyzed retrospective data for RA patients who initiated Adalimumab between 2020 and 2023. We built and evaluated multiple models (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), elastic net regularized logistic regression (Elastic Net), support vector machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). Hyperparameters were tuned via Bayesian optimization or Grid search to maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Thresholds were selected to maximize F1 score. A total of 300 RA patients met the study inclusion criteria, with 37.7% classified as high-risk for early Adalimumab discontinuation. 19 baseline features were selected from clinical and patient-reported data, with symptom severity and therapy type. On the test set, Elastic Net achieved the highest discriminative performance (AUC-ROC = 0.886; F1 score = 0.741), followed closely by LDA and SVM. These models demonstrated consistent ability to identify high-risk patients using data available at clinical service initiation.
- **Prospective Observational Validation Study (_2025 - Present_)**: The follow-up study designed to assess the ML models’ generalizability in a new patient cohort initiating adalimumab between September 2025 and August 2026. Patients will be followed for at least nine months. The primary outcome is discontinuation due to lack or loss of efficacy within six months among patients who demonstrate adequate adherence. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) will be applied to the best-performing model to generate individualized risk explanations, which will be reviewed by clinical pharmacists to assess usability and clinical insight. We will also evaluate the impact of advanced imputation strategies such as Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) on model calibration and predictive performance.

**PBM GLP-1 Optimizer: Predictive Model for Clinical Obesity Management (_2025 - Present_)**
- This project focuses on developing a specialized deep learning model, the PBM GLP-1 Optimizer, to improve the management of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for patients with clinical obesity, excluding those with a diabetes diagnosis. By applying advanced predictive analytics to a comprehensive dataset of claims and prior-authorization records, this tool aims to optimize drug utilization, enhance member outcomes, and ensure a fiscally responsible approach to these high-cost therapies.
- High-Value Candidate Identification: The model will identify patients who are most likely to achieve and sustain the clinical goals of GLP-1 therapy. This will allow for more accurate and data-driven prior authorization approvals, ensuring that the PBM's investment is directed toward members who are most likely to benefit. This approach helps to improve member outcomes while also managing costs effectively.
- Real-Time Utilization Management: By integrating with the PBM's pharmacy claims and prior authorization systems, the model can provide real-time insights during the PA review process. It will flag cases that are most likely to be high-responders or high-risk for discontinuation, enabling faster and more accurate approval decisions.

**Onco-Talk: Multi-Stakeholder LLM for Breast Cancer Care (_2025 - Present_)**
- This project focuses on developing a specialized Large Language Model (LLM), named Onco-Talk, designed to streamline and improve the breast cancer treatment process for all key parties involved. By fine-tuning a foundational model on the most current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, this tool aims to enhance clinical decision support, accelerate administrative workflows for providers, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of a prior authorization review for third-party payers. This project bridges the gap between rapidly evolving medical knowledge and clinical and administrative workflows, demonstrating a practical application of AI in healthcare that benefits the entire system.
